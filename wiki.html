<p class="wikibody">Pens are an important part of our daily lives. Therefore, it is important that you have a good
    quality pen (or pencil) to write with. It is the primary goal of the Melbourne Club of Stylophiles to find the
    perfect pen, and these are some of our recommendations.</p>
<h2>Best Everyday Writing Pen</h2>
<h3>Pilot G-2</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vthyrf" target="_blank"><img id="pilotg2"
                src="./images/wiki/pilotg2img1.jpg" alt="Pilot G-2 Pen"></a>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
        <p class="bodytext">The Pilot G-2 gets our pick for the best everyday writing pen. While it may not look the
            most aesthetically pleasing, its ergonomic grip makes writing with it easy on the hands. Furthermore, its
            ink is ideal for writing for long periods of time. You can't go wrong with the Pilot G-2.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">The Pilot G-2's have been around since 1997, and Pilot have found a design that works
            exceptionally well. It is one of the best selling pens in the world, and are easy to use.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="price">Price: $4.86</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Where to buy: <a href="https://bit.ly/3vthyrf">Officeworks</a> <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Pilot-G-2-Gel-Ink-Pen/dp/B006CQRLEO?ref_=ast_sto_dp">Amazon</a>

<h2>Best Looking Pen (that works well too)</h2>
<h3>Uni-Ball Signo Micro 307</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <p class="bodytext">The staff pick for the category of "Best Looking Pen" is the Uni-Ball Signo Micro 307. The
            barrel of the pen is adorned with a subtle grid pattern giving it a nice carbon fiber look. It also writes
            exceptionally well, and would be the top pick overall if the ink had a more intense colour and was more
            consistent.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The successor to Uni-Ball's best selling pen, the Signo Micro 207, is a great pen to write
            with and is good looking as well. It is also slightly cheaper than the Pilot G-2.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="price">Price: $4.40</p>

<h2>Best Woodcase Pencil</h2>
<h3>Blackwing Pencils</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <a href="https://bit.ly/3zqWvIL"><img id="pilotg2" src="./images/wiki/blackwing1.jpg" alt="BLACKWING PEARL"></a>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
        <p class="bodytext">The Blackwing Pencils are simply the best pencils that a person can buy. They are made with
            the best Japanese graphite, and the woodcases of the pencils are made from incense-cedar from California.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">They come in four different types, and all have different uses. We recommend the Blackwing
            Pearls, as the graphite is good for both drawing and writing, as opposed to
            the other variations.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">These pencils are more expensive than most pencils, and are only sold in boxes of 12.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="price">Price: $59.95 for 12</p>
